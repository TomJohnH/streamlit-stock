2011-07,"<p>European stocks ended modestly higher on July 1, with Britain's FTSE 100 rising 0.7%, the DAX in Germany and France's CAC 40 adding 0.6%[^2^][1]. However, the stock market crashed later that month, losing about 28% of its value from July 22 to August 9 due to concerns over the U.S. debt ceiling and the European debt crisis[^3^][2]. The market did bounce off that low and then resumed its downward trend until October.</p>"

The Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a record high of 29,551.42 on Feb. 12, but then began to drop on Feb. 20 and fell by 7.79% on March 9.</p>
<p>Another source shows the historical data of the S&P 500 index for February 2020. The index opened at 3,248.92 on Feb. 3 and closed at 2,954.22 on Feb. 28, losing about 9% over the month.</p>
<p>A third source provides a broader perspective of the stock market performance in 2020. It says that the year was marked by two different bull markets, with a short-lived bear market in between. The first bull market ended in February when the pandemic hit, and the second one began in late March when investors regained confidence due to stimulus measures and vaccine developments.</p>"
