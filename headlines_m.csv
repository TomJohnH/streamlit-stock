2011-07,"<p>European stocks ended modestly higher on July 1, with Britain's FTSE 100 rising 0.7%, the DAX in Germany and France's CAC 40 adding 0.6%[^2^][1]. However, the stock market crashed later that month, losing about 28% of its value from July 22 to August 9 due to concerns over the U.S. debt ceiling and the European debt crisis[^3^][2]. The market did bounce off that low and then resumed its downward trend until October.</p> <p>The European debt crisis, also known as the Eurozone crisis, began in late 2009 and lasted through much of the 2010s. In 2011, the crisis reached a critical point, with several European countries facing the possibility of defaulting on their sovereign debt.</p><p>
The crisis was triggered by a combination of factors, including high levels of government debt, low economic growth, and the global financial crisis of 2008. The crisis affected several countries in the European Union, including Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and Italy.</p><p>
The crisis led to a number of measures being taken by the European Union and its member states to address the situation. These measures included the creation of the European Stability Mechanism, which provided financial assistance to countries in need, and the implementation of austerity measures in affected countries.</p><p>
The crisis had a significant impact on the European economy and led to high levels of unemployment, particularly in countries like Greece and Spain. It also had political ramifications, with some countries questioning the viability of the European Union and the euro currency. While the crisis has largely receded in recent years, its effects are still being felt in some parts of Europe.</p>"
